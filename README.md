# Assignment 1 â€“ Image search
_The portfolio for Visual Analytics S22 consists of 4 projects (3 class assignments and 1 self-assigned project). This is **the first** assignment in the portfolio._


## 1. Contribution
The initial assignment was made partly in collaboration with others from the course, but the final code was made by me(???)


## 2. Assignment description
This assignment was assigned by Ross, and the assignment description was as follows:

For this assignment, you will write a small Python program to compare image histograms quantitively using Open-CV and the other image processing tools you've already encountered. Your script should do the following:

- Take a user-defined image from the folder
- Calculate the "distance" between the colour histogram of that image and all of the others.
- Find which 3 image are most "similar" to the target image.
- Save an image which shows the target image, the three most similar, and the calculated distance score.
- Save a CSV which has one column for the filename and three columns showing the filenames of the closest images in descending order
